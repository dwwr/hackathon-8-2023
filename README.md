# hackathon-8-2023

## Rationale

VR tools afford a new platform for immersive user experiences. Through the senses of sight and touch, content can be made more impactful and leave a greater impression on the audience. For geosocial issues like climate change, VR provides an opportunity to visualize and contextualize, amplifying the impact of data and calling the audience to action. Otherwise, the dire importance of the content can be undercut by a barrage of data that is often hard to grasp.

This hackathon utilizes the carbon title api to visualize properties within a given range and provide information about a given building's location and carbon footprint, inviting users to see and hopefully grasp the importance of attaining carbon neutrality.
